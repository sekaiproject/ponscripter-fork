This folder contains a SDL 1.2.13 Win32 DLL and static libraries for
using the DLL with MinGW compilations, but with a Makefile and sdl-config
specifically for compiling Ponscripter.

 This is provided for MinGW builds of Ponscripter, which would normally
use all static libraries, because MinGW apparently has problems with building
an SDL 1.2 library that can use DirectSound.

 This would not normally be a problem, except that the default Windows
audio system for SDL doesn't handle playing a quick series of short sound
effects properly, apparently because of buffer size issues.

 Luckily, the provided SDL.dll has DirectSound support, and is included to
allow building Ponscripter executables that can use DirectSound.

The source code for SDL 1.2.13 is provided under the "extlib" folder.
