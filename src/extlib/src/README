This source code is that used to build static Ponscripter executables,
in accordance with the GNU GPL's requirements.

If you want to use these libraries as such, you should probably download
their source code from their respective creators, since the source
provided here has been trimmed somewhat to remove features not used in
Ponscripter, tests, documentation, and so forth.
